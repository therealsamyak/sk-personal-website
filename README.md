# [skakatur.dev](https://skakatur.dev)

My personal website and blog. Built with Next.js, Astro (EmDash CMS), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Hosted on Cloudflare Workers free tier.

## Tech Stack

- **Web (Portfolio)** ([apps/web](apps/web))
  - Next.js, deployed to Cloudflare Workers via [OpenNext](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare)
- **Blog** ([apps/blog](apps/blog))
  - Astro ([EmDash CMS](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash)), deployed to Cloudflare Workers

## Local Development

The repository is a monorepo utilizing [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) and [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo).

Each app has its own `.env.example`, copy and fill in values:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.development
cp apps/blog/.env.example apps/blog/.env.development
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the build and dev commands to get started:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev
```

Dev servers are proxied through [Portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless), giving each app a stable `.localhost` URL (`web.localhost`, `blog.localhost`) instead of raw port numbers. `pnpm dev` starts the proxy before Turborepo kicks in (one password prompt to start, another to stop on exit). If the proxy is already running, it's left untouched. Requires Node.js 24+.

## Deployment

Both apps deploy to Cloudflare Workers. Each app has its own `.env.production` with the necessary secrets and config.

#### Web

```bash
pnpm run cf-deploy-website
```

#### Blog

```bash
pnpm run cf-deploy-blog
```

Ensure environment variables / secrets are set via the Cloudflare Dashboard under **Compute** --> **Workers & Pages** --> **(Worker Name)** --> **Settings** --> **Variables and Secrets**.
